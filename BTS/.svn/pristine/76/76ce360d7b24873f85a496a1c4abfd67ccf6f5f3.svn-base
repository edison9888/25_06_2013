This opens the door for you to show how you can discuss Sunnydale Psychiatry’s goals. Also, you would have learned that Dr. Bennett feels that his patients are more and more educated about their condition and the products used to treat it. As a prescriber, he would feel more confident if he had more information about patient types who would most benefit from being put on a particular product, and why.</welcomeText>]]></descriptionText>
