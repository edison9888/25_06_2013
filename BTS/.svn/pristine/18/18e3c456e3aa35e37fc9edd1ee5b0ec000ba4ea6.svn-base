A full-service hospital, Maycomb is a leader in the fields of cardiovascular, orthopedics, neurosurgery, and critical care. It is home to a certified chest pain center and heart failure clinic.<BR><BR>
        Like most hospitals, Maycomb is placing increased scrutiny on length of stay and readmission rates, as well as efficiency measures that will help reduce costs.  However, there is no data with Samsca on length of stay or readmission rates. As one of the “top 100” hospitals for cardiac care, Maycomb also places significant importance on its reputation, and wants to maintain or improve its quality scores.<BR>
        You have been calling on Maycomb for over a year, and have already achieved some notable success in the account.  Your first prescriber was Dr. Michael Rivers, a nephrologist, and Samsca is now prescribed regularly by him, and occasionally by a couple of his partners.  Just two months ago, Samsca was added to Maycomb’s formulary, thanks in large part to the support of Dr. Rivers, other nephrologists, and intensivists.  You have also recently gotten the support of several cardiologists, notably Dr. Rachel Gomez, a newer cardiologist; and Dr. Andrew Cardonza, the chief cardiologist.<BR>
        
        Thanks to the support of Dr. Gomez, you have a meeting scheduled with Dr. Matt Chu, a hospitalist at Maycomb.  Although you had previously talked to Dr. Chu a few times about Samsca, he had always raised concerns about the safety and efficacy of the product.  However, now that cardiology is prescribing Samsca, and especially with Pharmacy more open to the use of the product, Dr. Chu appears willing to consider Samsca as a treatment option for appropriate patient types.  In your last conversation with him, he indicated that he was focused on improving all aspects of the patient experience; you are hoping to learn more about this goal of his.<BR><BR>
        
        With the success you’ve had with nephrology and cardiology, you’re confident that you can extend and deepen your network of prescribers within Maycomb.  You’re looking forward to your meeting with Dr. Chu as a way to begin working with the hospitalists at Maycomb. </welcomeText><br><br><lasttext style="font-family:Helvetica; font-size:11pt; color:#000; background-color:#c0c0c0; margin:10px; padding:2px 0 2px 5px; display:block;"><i>Please press or swipe the <b>CONTINUE</b> button to move to the next screen.</i></lasttext>]]></descriptionText>
