At this point in the conversation, it is important to understand the desired outcomes for the practice, not the specific details around who will be executing the strategy.<BR><BR>The first question you ask Rachel should be one that opens the conversation around practice knowledge and outcomes that the practice is trying to achieve.<BR><BR>The best question is, "From our previous conversations, I understand that improving the efficiency of your office will be a key to success as the practice grows.  What metric will you use to track your progress toward that goal?"  This Results question begins to create a foundation for aligning with the practice’s goals and priorities, which is the best beginning point for becoming a trusted advisor.  Whenever you begin the prescribing process with a consideration of the practice’s goals, it enhances your ability to advance the prescribing cycle.<BR><BR><B>You need to know the answer to this question to continue.  Here is how Rachel would have answered that question:</B><BR><BR>"We will be using a variety of metrics – number of patient visits per month, average patient wait time, and frequency of patient follow-up visits due to ineffective treatments.  Our goal is to grow our patient base and increase our efficiency, both without increasing our staff.  It’s an ambitious target, but with the right strategies, I think we can make it happen."</welcomeText>]]></descriptionText>
