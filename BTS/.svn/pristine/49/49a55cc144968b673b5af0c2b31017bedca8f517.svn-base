It doesn’t advance the conversation to the point where you fully explore how Samsca can create value for the top priorities that Dr. Chu has already identified. <BR> <BR>
        
        The best question is, “Do you foresee any other barriers in achieving your goals for patient safety and patient experience?” <BR> <BR>
        This Problems question helps probe deeper into issues faced by Dr. Chu without jumping prematurely to solutions. <BR> <BR>
        <B>It will help you to know the answer to this question to continue.  Here is how Dr. Chu would have answered: </B><BR> <BR>
        
        “Let’s face it, time is always a challenge.  As much as I would like to collaborate more with Pharmacy, bring in specialist consults, and spend more time with patients, that won’t always be possible.  I’m already stretched thin, and I know every hospitalist at Maycomb feels the same time pressures that I do.  However, once I start implementing some of these ideas, I could very well see some improvement.  For instance, if I can bring in a consult for my more difficult cases, that will free me up to spend more time with the other patients, which should increase their satisfaction.”</welcomeText>]]></descriptionText>
