As a trusted advisor, however, you need to fully explore Dr. Chu’s goals and priorities.<BR><BR>
        
        The best question is, “What strategies can you use to help ensure patient safety, which is the other priority you indicated?”<BR><BR>
        
        This is an Options question that continues to explore Dr. Chu’s focus on patient safety.<BR><BR>
        
        <B>It will help you to know the answer to this question to continue.  Here is how Dr. Chu would have answered:</B><BR><BR>
        
        “I see two big opportunities here.  The first is to engage in more specialist consults.  As you might guess, as a hospitalist I know a little bit about everything, but not enough to handle very specific or complicated cases.  Bringing in a specialist would help increase my peace of mind and also improve patient safety.  Second, I could collaborate more closely with Pharmacy.  Pharmacy frequently calls me with suggestions or concerns; if I did the same and proactively contacted Pharmacy, I’m sure our results would improve even more.”</welcomeText>]]></descriptionText>
