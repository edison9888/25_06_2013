Three psychiatrists and one APRN practice at the facility.  The lead psychiatrist is Dr. Bernard Hayes, but your primary contact for the last year has been with Dr. Will Bennett, a younger doctor who has been more receptive to prescribing your product.<br><br><span style="color:#3366cc; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Basic information about Sunnydale Psychiatry:</span><li style="font-family:Helvetica; font-size:12pt; color:#333; list-style-type:disc;">Dr. Bernard Hayes started the practice 20 years ago</li><li>Other clinical staff include Dr. Will Bennett, Dr. Teresa Roberts, and Angela Martinez, APRN</li><li style="font-family:Helvetica; font-size:12pt; color:#333; list-style-type:disc;">With the exception of Dr. Hayes, all clinical staff rotate to other facilities, including local <span style="margin:0 0 0 15px;">hospitals and community mental health centers</span></li><li>Dr. Hayes wants to continue growing the practice, and at least somewhat reduce the time the <span style="margin:0 0 0 15px;">other clinical staff spends at different facilities</span></li><li>Sunnydale Psychiatry has one of the highest volumes of patients with depression in the city</li><li style="font-family:Helvetica; font-size:12pt; color:#333; list-style-type:disc;">Currently, your product is prescribed rarely by the physicians, typically as a last resort</li><li>In general, the office prefers to "stick to what has worked in the past"</li><li style="font-family:Helvetica; font-size:12pt; color:#333; list-style-type:disc;">As the office gets busier, it is beginning to restrict access to the staff</li><br>You’ve built a solid relationship with Dr. Bennett over the past year, and you have seen an increase in his use of your product in the office.  However, you now have your sights set on increasing the prescribing of all the doctors in the office and on establishing your product as the atypical of choice.  After working with Annie DeMarco, you have decided that this should be your global A to B shift with this practice. You know that Dr. Hayes wants the practice to grow.  You believe you’ve also positioned yourself as a valued resource: the office appreciates your deep product knowledge and understanding of their practice, as well as the promotional program opportunities you provide.<br><br>You have a strong understanding of Sunnydale Psychiatry.  It’s clear that with the right approach, they could become one of your largest accounts.</welcomeText><br><lasttext style="font-family:Helvetica; font-size:11pt; color:#000; background-color:#c0c0c0; margin:10px; padding:2px 0 2px 5px; display:block;"><i>Please click the <b>Continue</b> button to move to the next screen.</i></lasttext>]]></descriptionText>
