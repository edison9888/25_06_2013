The first is to engage in more specialist consults.  As you might guess, as a hospitalist I know a little bit about everything, but not enough to handle very specific or complicated cases.  Bringing in a specialist would help increase my peace of mind and also improve patient safety.  Second, I could collaborate more closely with Pharmacy.  Pharmacy frequently calls me with suggestions or concerns; if I did the same and proactively contacted Pharmacy, Iâ€™m sure our results would improve even more.  </welcomeText>]]></descriptionText>
