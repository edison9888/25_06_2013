It doesn’t advance the conversation to the point where you can discuss Samsca as an option for the priorities that Dr. Chu has already identified.<BR><BR>
        The best question is, “As you focus on these key goals of patient safety and patient experience, do you anticipate any conflicts in meeting Maycomb’s other goals, especially those around cost and efficiency?”<BR><BR>
