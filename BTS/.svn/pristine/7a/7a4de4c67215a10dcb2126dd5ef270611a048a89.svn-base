            <descriptionText><![CDATA[<font face="helvetica" size="3">Dr. Bernard Hayes is the lead psychiatrist at Sunnydale Psychiatry. Since you began calling on Sunnydale Psychiatry over a year ago, Dr. Hayes has been a difficult customer to access.  In general he avoids conversations with pharmaceutical reps, preferring to have the other prescribers in the office relay the information to him. He also likes sticking to treatments that have worked for him in the past.  From your conversations with Dr. Bennett, however, you know that Dr. Hayes has some big growth goals for Sunnydale Psychiatry.  You think you can offer value in helping to achieve those goals, but you also know that Dr. Hayes will not be an easy customer to convince.</font>]]></descriptionText>
