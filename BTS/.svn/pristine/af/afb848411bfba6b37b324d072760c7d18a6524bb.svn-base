A lot of the patients who are referred to Sunnydale have been struggling with depression for years; they’ve been moved from product to product without experiencing the relief they need, and they’ve undergone a lot of unpleasant side effects. By the time I see the patients, they’re jaded and don’t have much confidence left in doctors.  When I see a new patient like this, I want the first product I put them on to work.  In order for that to happen, I have to truly understand their history and why their previous treatments were unsuccessful.  They also need to be able to afford and take the medication.  Patients don’t forget doctors who make a difference in their lives – and they also tell everyone they know</welcomeText>]]></descriptionText>
