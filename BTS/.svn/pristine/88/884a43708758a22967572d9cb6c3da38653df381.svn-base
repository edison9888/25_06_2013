It will take you backward in the conversation and make it difficult to reconnect to the value creation discussion you are already building.<BR><BR>The best question to ask at this point is, "What other obstacles do you face as you drive toward your goals for patient outcomes?"<BR>This is a Problems question that probes deeper into the issues Dr. Hayes faces in his practice.<BR><BR><B>Here is how Dr. Hayes would have answered that question:</B><BR><BR>"A lot of times, it’s the administrative details that bog us down.
