If you get into problems at this stage, it will be harder to identify options and present the full potential value of your solution.<BR><BR>The best question to ask now is, "You mentioned that expanding your areas of specialty was part of your long-term goals.  What strategies will you use to build that part of your practice and become recognized in these new areas?"<BR><BR>This is an Options question that continues to explore ways to build the value of your product.<BR><BR><B>Here is how Dr. Hayes would have answered that question:</B><BR><BR>"We need to learn to capitalize on the staff that we already have.  Dr. Roberts has extensive experience and success treating schizophrenia.  Angela Martinez, our APRN, rotates to another clinic where she treats a lot of patients with anxiety and eating disorders.  I have a lot of post doctorate work with bipolar disorder.  We need to build our credibility in these disease states by being more active in the healthcare community, such as at education events.  We also need to network so that others will know they can make referrals to us."</welcomeText>]]></descriptionText>
