        Another aspect to consider is prompt discharge.  Keeping patients longer than necessary makes them feel unimportant and forgotten.  Since discharge is their last memory of the hospital, we want to ensure it’s a smooth process in order to keep our satisfaction rates up.”

        This is a Problems question and it puts the conversation on a different track.  In addition, it will be difficult to raise the topic of options.
        
        The best question is, “You’ve raised an interesting point about the ‘personal touch,’ which, if lacking, would hurt patient experience.  What are some ways you see to help ensure the personal touch remains, considering Maycomb’s focus on cost-effective, efficient care?”
        This is an Options question that moves from the previous answer to discussing options.
        
        <B>It will help you to know the answer to this question to continue.  Here is how Dr. Chu would have answered:</B>
        
        “I think there are a couple of things I can do.  Patient education is key.  The hospital experience can be overwhelming for many patients, so I need to spend sufficient time with them to ensure they understand their condition and how to continue care after discharge.  With so many patients, it can be a challenge to spend adequate time with each one, but this is critical.  
        
        Another aspect to consider is prompt discharge.  Keeping patients longer than necessary makes them feel unimportant and forgotten.  Since discharge is their last memory of the hospital, we want to ensure it’s a smooth process in order to keep our satisfaction rates up.”

        This is an Options question that continues to explore Dr. Chu’s focus on patient safety. He sees specialist consults and collaboration with Pharmacy as ways to improve patient safety. As a representative of Samsca, this is important information for you to know.

Bringing in a specialist would help increase my peace of mind and also improve patient safety.  Second, I could collaborate more closely with Pharmacy.

            This is an Options question, not a Problems question.  It doesn’t advance the conversation to the point where you fully explore how Samsca can create value for the top priorities that Dr. Chu has already identified.
            
            The best question is, “Do you foresee any other barriers in achieving your goals for patient safety and patient experience?”
            This Problems question helps probe deeper into issues faced by Dr. Chu without jumping prematurely to solutions.<BR><BR>
            <B>It will help you to know the answer to this question to continue.  Here is how Dr. Chu would have answered:</B><BR><BR>“Let’s face it, time is always a challenge.  As much as I would like to collaborate more with Pharmacy, bring in specialist consults, and spend more time with patients, that won’t always be possible.  I’m already stretched thin, and I know every hospitalist at Maycomb feels the same time pressures that I do.  However, once I start implementing some of these ideas, I could very well see some improvement.  For instance, if I can bring in a consult for my more difficult cases, that will free me up to spend more time with the other patients, which should increase their satisfaction.”

            This is an Execute Next Steps question, but it doesn’t build on the previous conversation. It might advance the conversation to this specific topic, but it’s closed-ended, and it doesn’t engage Dr. Chu in partnering to create value.
            
            The best question is, “You’ve mentioned consulting more with Pharmacy, and I understand your desire to be familiar with the safety profile of what you prescribe.  When you consider trying a product you have never used before, such as Samsca, what factors are important to you?”
            This Execute Next Steps question moves you toward taking action and helps you to better understand how to position yourself as an advisor to decision makers.

            “I’ll begin by saying that I would very rarely be one of the first people in a hospital to try a product.

In my position as a hospitalist, I see such a wide variety of patients that I can’t be fully up to speed on the specialized therapies they might need.  That’s why the specialist consults are important.
            
            However, if the product was already adopted and supported by the hospital and Pharmacy, then I must be comfortable with the drug’s safety and efficacy profile, and it must be available at a reasonable cost.”
