This could come in a variety of ways, such as increasing the types of insurance we accept; however, we’d really like to see it come through satisfied patients. Ensuring that they are paying the right amount of money for their medications will allow them to be more compliant.<br><br>Long-term, we want to expand our areas of specialty.  Although we treat all types of psychiatric disorders here at Sunnydale, we’re primarily known as a depression clinic.  That’s great for us, because we get a lot of referrals, but we’d like to build our reputation for treatment of other disorders as well.</welcomeText>]]></descriptionText>
