This is allowing us to review their response to the various therapies we employ; for example, fluid restriction.  We have noticed that some patients complained about not being able to drink.  Additionally, some of these patients did not respond well, as their serum sodium levels took several days to increase even slightly. <br>Our next step will be to take the information and apply the learning in our treatment to future patients." </welcomeText>]]></descriptionText>
