By going directly to execution issues, you are losing the opportunity to build up the value of your product by connecting it to the practice’s desired patient outcomes.<br><br>The best question to ask at this point is, "Ensuring that patients receive the appropriate and best medication helps to increase patient satisfaction. What strategies will you use to ensure minimal disruptions to your staff and patients, when needing to deal with issues like formularies?"<br><br>This is an Options question that moves from the previous answer to beginning to establish the value of considering your product. In letting Dr. Hayes describe the value instead of you telling him what you can offer, you engage him in a conversation around creating value.<br><br><b>Here is how Dr. Hayes would have answered that question:</b><BR><BR>That’s a good question. To start, we need to capitalize on our resources that we have within the office to effectively manage the flow of existing and new patients. My nursing staff will need to work closely with me to keep me abreast of different formularies for each plan and any formulary changes.  Finally, we’ll need to build the trust very quickly with our new patient base.</welcomeText>]]></descriptionText>
