As you engage him in a conversation about how the practice is doing, Dr. Bennett seems a bit distant.<BR><BR>When you probe a little further to uncover what is bothering him, he finally says, "Dr. Hayes wrote his first prescription for your product last week.  Then yesterday, he got a phone call from the patient – she had gone to fill the prescription, and she found out that her insurance didn’t cover the product, and it would cost her $500 for a month’s supply.  I had the front office help, and it looks like if we go through a lengthy prior-authorization process, the product will be covered.<BR><BR>But Dr. Hayes isn’t pleased, and we can’t go through this hassle every time we prescribe a product.  The experience brought back all of Dr. Hayes’ reasons for sticking to lower cost and more familiar products."</welcomeText>]]></descriptionText>
