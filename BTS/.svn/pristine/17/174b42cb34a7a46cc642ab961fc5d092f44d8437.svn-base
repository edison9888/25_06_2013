To me, the patient experience is about much more than being appropriately treated – it is the overall care, compassion, and respect with which they are treated. It’s also about making sure they aren’t exposed to unnecessary safety risks.  I often like to think of what the patient will say about the hospital after they are discharged.  Did they truly feel that Maycomb provided them with the best possible care?  </welcomeText>]]></descriptionText>
