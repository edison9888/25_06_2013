It focuses too narrowly on the implementation of the strategy instead of exploring ways you and your product can create new value for the customer.<BR><BR>The best question to ask at this point is, "What strategies will you use to understand, and communicate to the prescribers, the insurance coverage of individual patients?"<BR><BR>This is an Options question that moves from the previous answer to discussing options. By letting Rachel describe the value instead of you telling her what you can offer, you engage her in a conversation around creating value.<BR><BR><B>Here is how Rachel would have answered that question:</B><BR><BR>We’re making a big change in expectations of who in the office should know the details of insurance coverage and formularies.  Previously, we relied on the prescribers.  However, we’re now transitioning that responsibility to some of the non-prescribing staff, namely, the nurses and two staff members from the front office.  These staff will be responsible for communicating the information to the prescribers prior to the patient visit, and for confirming coverage of prescriptions before they are given to the patient.  If this works well, it will have a huge impact on our efficiency and on patient satisfaction.  </welcomeText>]]></descriptionText>
