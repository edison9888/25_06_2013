It doesn’t advance the conversation to the point where you fully explore how your product can create value for the top priority that Dr. Hayes has already identified.<BR><BR>The best question to ask is, "New treatment areas will definitely provide an opportunity for your practice. However, with the ongoing healthcare reform and increasing regulations, what difficulties do you feel that you will have implementing your ideas"<BR><BR>This is a Problems question that probes Dr. Hayes’ response to the previous question. It also helps you align strategically with Dr. Hayes’ priorities.<BR><BR><B>Note how Dr. Hayes would have answered that question:</B><BR><BR>"I’ve wanted to start a non-standard treatment for patients who haven’t responded to traditional methods.  However, with insurance and Medicare and Medicaid, and all the hoops and roadblocks put in the way, I’ve had to keep patients on less-efficacious treatments.  Regulations and reform have their place, but I also feel they can negatively impact my effectiveness as a doctor."</welcomeText>]]></descriptionText>
