As you know, I’m cautious and safety-focused, so I wouldn’t begin a new product unless Pharmacy supported it or I had peers with experience prescribing it.  In my position as a hospitalist, I see such a wide variety of patients that I can’t be fully up to speed on the specialized therapies they might need.  That’s why the specialist consults are important.<BR><BR>
        
        However, if the product was already adopted and supported by the hospital and Pharmacy, then I must be comfortable with the drug’s safety and efficacy profile, and it must be available at a reasonable cost.</welcomeText>]]></descriptionText>
