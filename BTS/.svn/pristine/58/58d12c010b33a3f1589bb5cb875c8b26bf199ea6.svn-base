You also know that Dr. Cardonza has expressed concern over the subjective nature of measuring patient satisfaction, as a necessary treatment may be unpleasant for a patient.<br><br>From your knowledge, you know that several factors impact patient satisfaction: providers’ listening skills, whether providers spend adequate time with patients, the explanations providers give to patients’ questions, and the quality of providers’ advice and treatment. You feel that if the cardiologists at Maycomb are fully informed of the treatment options for dilutional hyponatremia, this may help them influence some of these factors.<br><br>Before your next meeting with Dr. Gomez, you write “education” in the How line of the Value Map. Now you’d like to position education as a way to help Dr. Gomez achieve the department’s priorities.</welcomeText>]]></descriptionText>
