Tell Dr. Gomez that you will plan to meet with Michelle Hinley in Pharmacy.  It has been some time since your last meeting with her, which occurred during the formulary review process. At that time, she was resistant but ultimately agreed to allow access to Samsca for nephrology. You will work closely with Michelle,...<b>READ MORE</b> discussing the benefits and risks of prescribing Samsca for heart failure patients with hyponatremia, and providing pertinent information, such as clinical trial results.  Once Michelle understands the benefits of Samsca for use with hyponatremia in heart failure, she may be more supportive of its use. </welcomeText>]]></choiceText>

Providing a clear understanding to Pharmacy about the benefits and risks of Samsca for different patient types is the best way to handle Michelle’s and Dr. Gomez’s concern at this stage of the prescribing cycle. If you choose to provide strategies to counter Pharmacy’s concerns (Choice A), you are jumping ahead to the next phase of the prescribing cycle, without closing on this phase. You have already worked through fair balance and have helped Dr. Gomez evaluate all her options, so Choice C is not the ideal way to respond, either. Choice D is an okay choice, but you should have already planned out your targets for this customer on a value map, so this may or may not resolve the current concerns they have.
