            <descriptionText><![CDATA[<font face="helvetica" size="3">With the success you’ve had with nephrology, you’re confident that you can extend and deepen your network of prescribers within Maycomb.  You’d especially like to focus on the cardiology department, given their high volume of patients and their reputation for state-of-the-art treatment.  After all, it’s common to see patients hospitalized with decompensated heart failure present with hyponatremia.  After working with Annie, you have decided that expanding the prescriber base through the cardiologists and driving repeat use, including use in different patient types, with the nephrologists should be your global A to B shift with this hospital.<br>You have a strong understanding of Maycomb Community Hospital.  It’s clear that with the right approach, they could become one of your best performing accounts.</font> ]]></descriptionText>

            <descriptionText><![CDATA[<Introtext style="font-family:Helvetica; font-size:16pt; font-weight:bold; color:#cc0033; margin:10px; padding:0 0 0 5px; background:#e8e8e8; border-bottom:1px solid #333; display:block;">Your Customer</Introtext><welcomeText style=" font-family:Helvetica; font-size:12pt; line-height:18pt; text-align:justify; font-weight:normal; color:#333; display:block; margin:0 10px 10px">Maycomb Community Hospital (Maycomb) is a large, 400-bed community medical center located in a suburban area.  A full-service hospital, Maycomb is a leader in the fields of cardiovascular, orthopedics, neurosurgery, and critical care. It is home to a certified chest pain center and heart failure clinic.<br>You have been calling on Maycomb for the past 12 months, and have already achieved some notable success in the account.  Your first prescriber was Dr. Michael Rivers, a nephrologist, and Samsca is now prescribed regularly by him, and occasionally by a couple of his partners.  Just two months ago, Samsca was added to Maycomb’s formulary, thanks in large part to the support of Dr. Rivers, other nephrologists, and intensivists.<br><br><span style="color:#3366cc; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Other information about Maycomb Community Hospital:</span><li style="font-family:Helvetica; font-size:12pt; color:#333; list-style-type:disc;">Maycomb is a highly respected hospital, with many individual physicians noted for expertise in their area of specialty. </li><li style="font-family:Helvetica; font-size:12pt; color:#333; list-style-type:disc;">The cardiovascular department has received national recognition as “one of the 100 best hospitals” for cardiac care. Maintaining this standing for positive patient treatment goals is a priority for the cardiology department.</li><li style="font-family:Helvetica; font-size:12pt; color:#333; list-style-type:disc;">Maycomb is not-for-profit.  However, especially in light of healthcare reform, the hospital is concerned about more cost-effectively treating patients.</li><li style="font-family:Helvetica; font-size:12pt; color:#333; list-style-type:disc;">Hospital leadership is placing increased scrutiny around average length of stay and readmission rates.  However, there is no data with Samsca on length of stay or readmission rates.</li><br><br><span style="color:#3366cc; font-size:12pt; font-weight:bold">Sketch of Your Main Contacts</span><li style="font-family:Helvetica; font-size:12pt; color:#333; list-style-type:disc;"><b>Dr. Michael Rivers </b>is your champion.  He speaks very highly of Samsca, and was one of the physicians who effectively convinced Pharmacy to add it to formulary.  However, because of his hectic schedule, his support is limited.</li><li style="font-family:Helvetica; font-size:12pt; color:#333; list-style-type:disc;"><b>Dr. Gina Sardon</b> is a nephrologist who has begun to occasionally prescribe Samsca.  She seems pleased with the product, but has remarked to you, “Treatment with Samsca can’t be realistically continued  on an outpatient basis.  Patients would be bankrupt in a month.”</li><li style="font-family:Helvetica; font-size:12pt; color:#333; list-style-type:disc;">You’ve been trying to connect with <b>Dr. Andrew Cardonza</b>, the chief cardiologist.  Although you’ve managed a few brief conversations with him before, he’s always been rushed.  Once he remarked, “Treating hyponatremia is not a major concern for me or the cardiology department.  On the rare occasion that is an issue with a heart failure patient, I know how to handle it.”  As the leader of Maycomb’s most visible department, he weighs all his decisions carefully.  Although desiring to stay at the forefront of medical advances, he must be thoroughly convinced any changes he makes will benefit the hospital and its patients.  He cares deeply about his reputation, as well as the reputation of the department and hospital.</li><li style="font-family:Helvetica; font-size:12pt; color:#333; list-style-type:disc;"><b>Dr. Rachel Gomez</b>, Cardiologist, is the youngest and the newest member to the cardiovascular department at Maycomb.  You’ve spoken to her twice about Samsca, and she wants to learn more.  At the hospital where she completed her residency, she occasionally saw Samsca prescribed to treat hyponatremia in patients with heart failure, with positive results.  However, Dr. Gomez is hesitant to begin a new treatment Dr. Cardonza is unfamiliar with or doesn’t support.</li><li style="font-family:Helvetica; font-size:12pt; color:#333; list-style-type:disc;"><b>Dr. Rachel Pratt</b>, Intensivist, is open to prescribing Samsca.  She has prescribed Samsca twice before, but the last time was three months ago.  Dr. Pratt waits for “just the right patient.”  You are still regularly engaging Dr. Pratt in order to understand exactly what she means by that statement.</li><li style="font-family:Helvetica; font-size:12pt; color:#333; list-style-type:disc;"><b>Dr. Matt Chu</b>, Hospitalist.  You’ve engaged him in some thoughtful conversations, but the last time you spoke, he raised questions about the safety and efficacy of Samsca.  He’s interested in what Pharmacy thinks of Samsca, as well as how the specialists, particularly nephrology and cardiology, view the product. </li><li style="font-family:Helvetica; font-size:12pt; color:#333; list-style-type:disc;"><b>Michelle Hinley</b>, Pharmacist.  She was difficult to convince to add Samsca to formulary, and she still seems troubled by the high price of the product.  She’s also concerned about the safety of the product, and is evaluating an institutional protocol to ensure the appropriate use of Samsca.</li></welcomeText>]]></descriptionText>
