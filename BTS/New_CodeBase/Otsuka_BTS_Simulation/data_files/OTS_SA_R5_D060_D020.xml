Asking this question now will move the conversation backwards, and take you in a different direction.<BR><BR>
        The best question is, “Do you foresee any other barriers in achieving your goals for patient safety and patient experience?”<BR><BR>
        This Problems question helps probe deeper into issues faced by Dr. Chu without jumping prematurely to solutions.<BR><BR>
        <B>It will help you to know the answer to this question to continue.  Here is how Dr. Chu would have answered:</B><BR><BR>
        
        “Let’s face it, time is always a challenge.  As much as I would like to collaborate more with Pharmacy, bring in specialist consults, and spend more time with patients, that won’t always be possible.  I’m already stretched thin, and I know every hospitalist at Maycomb feels the same time pressures that I do.  However, once I start implementing some of these ideas, I could very well see some improvement.  For instance, if I can bring in a consult for my more difficult cases, that will free me up to spend more time with the other patients, which should increase their satisfaction.”</welcomeText>]]></descriptionText>
