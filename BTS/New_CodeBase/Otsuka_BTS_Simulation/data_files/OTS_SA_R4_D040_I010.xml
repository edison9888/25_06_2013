Dr. Cardonza requested more information on insurance coverage, which you have provided (payor map, Discharge Checklist, ACCESS brochure). You planned to talk to Dr. Cardonza to address any concerns he may have about prescribing Samsca for continuation after discharge and to make sure it’s the right direction for him to go with the patient he has in mind. The focus of that discussion was selecting appropriate patients in the hospital, with additional guidance on those appropriate for continuing treatment after discharge.<BR><BR>However, Dr. Cardonza left the meeting prior to making a prescribing decision.  It’s the end of the quarter. Your district manager is encouraging you to achieve the desired results. </welcomeText>]]></descriptionText>
