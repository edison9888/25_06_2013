As much as I would like to collaborate more with Pharmacy, bring in specialist consults, and spend more time with patients, that won’t always be possible.  I’m already stretched thin, and I know every hospitalist at Maycomb feels the same time pressures that I do.  However, once I start implementing some of these ideas, I could very well see some improvement.  For instance, if I can bring in a consult for my more difficult cases, that will free me up to spend more time with the other patients, which should increase their satisfaction.</welcomeText>]]></descriptionText>
