This would be a perfect opportunity to get a conversation started about patient types who may benefit from your product.  Since itâ€™s time for your regular visit to Maycomb anyway, you plan to speak to Dr. Gomez about trends that are affecting the cardiology department and the hospital, so that you can better position yourself as a partner.</welcomeText>]]></descriptionText>
