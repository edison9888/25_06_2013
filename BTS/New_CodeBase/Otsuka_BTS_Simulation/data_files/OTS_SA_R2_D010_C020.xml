Because no connection has been made to the department’s desired patient treatment goals, you do not know what goals are most important to Dr. Cardonza and where you should be aligning yourself.<br><br>The best question is, “From previous conversations with Dr. Gomez, I’ve learned that you want to continue building your department’s reputation and stay at the forefront of medical advances. As part of achieving those goals, what are the treatment goals you desire for your patients with hyponatremia?" This results question begins to create a foundation for aligning OAPI with the patient treatment goals, which is the best beginning point for becoming a trusted advisor. Whenever you begin the prescribing process with a consideration of the department’s treatment goals, it enhances your ability to advance the prescribing cycle.<br><br><b>You need to know the answer to this question to continue. Here is how Dr. Cardonza would have answered that question:</b><br><br>"Bottom line, my priorities are side effects, increase in serum sodium, and hyponatremia that has resisted correction to fluid restriction.<br>A couple other areas we focus on are patient satisfaction and solid achievement against quality indicators, such as JCAHO. We want our patients leaving the hospital confident that they received the best possible care, and we want to show that third parties recognize that quality as well. When we combine good statistics with high patient satisfaction, we have a formula for success. It’s one of the reasons we’re a top hospital for cardiac care.""</welcomeText>]]></descriptionText>
