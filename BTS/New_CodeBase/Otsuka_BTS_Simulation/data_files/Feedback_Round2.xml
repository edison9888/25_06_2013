While it might be an interesting question, it will take you back several steps in the conversation and in a different direction.<br>The best question to ask at this point is, “What factors or criteria are most important to you when you consider trialing a product you have never used before?”<br>This Execute Next Steps question moves you toward taking action and helps you to better understand what he values when making prescribing decisions. <br><b>Here is how Dr. Cardonza would have answered that question:</b><br>“I must be comfortable with a drug’s efficacy and safety profile.  Those are the givens.  After that, it should have good insurance coverage, be available at a reasonable cost, and shouldn’t be a hassle for my department to prescribe.  I won’t begin a new product just to have a new product.”</welcomeText>]]></summary>
