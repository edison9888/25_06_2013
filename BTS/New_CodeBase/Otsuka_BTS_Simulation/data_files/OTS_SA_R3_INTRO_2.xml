From that conversation, you learned that Dr. Cardonza cares about patient satisfaction, in addition to positive clinical outcomes.  You also learned that he has concerns about the measurement of patient satisfaction, since it is a less objective measure.  He wants to maintain or improve patient satisfaction, so Maycomb can remain one of the “top hospitals” for cardiac care. <BR><BR>You have continued broadening and deepening your network within Maycomb.  You’ve continued to meet with Dr. Sardon, Nephrologist, and have seen an increase in prescribing.  You’ve worked with Dr. Chu, Hospitalist, to further discuss his safety and efficacy concerns.  You’ve worked with Dr. Pratt, Intensivist, and have helped identify appropriate patients for Samsca. You’ve also had ongoing conversations with Pharmacy.<br><br>In your most recent visit to the cardiology department, you learned that one of Dr. Gomez’s hyponatremia in heart failure patients has been readmitted to the hospital.  This patient has clinically significant asymptomatic hyponatremia.  You learn this patient has been hospitalized numerous times, and that her hospital stay is frequently extended because of the difficulty associated with controlling her sodium levels.<br><br>You plan to work further with Dr. Gomez, your main contact within the cardiology department, in order to understand even further the priorities of the department and to explore ways to achieve the desired patient treatment goals.</welcomeText><br><br><lasttext style="font-family:Helvetica; font-size:11pt; color:#000; background-color:#c0c0c0; margin:10px; padding:2px 0 2px 5px; display:block;"><i>Please tap <b>Continue</b> or swipe to begin the simulation.</i></lasttext>]]></descriptionText>
