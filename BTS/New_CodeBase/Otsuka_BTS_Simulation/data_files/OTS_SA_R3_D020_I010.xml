I hope your week is going well. I wanted to check in because the last time we spoke it was specific to a patient readmitted with clinically significant asymptomatic hyponatremia.  I’m interested in hearing how things are going with the treatment of that patient.”<BR><BR>Dr. Gomez – “We’ve had the patient on fluid restriction for the past 36 hours. It hasn’t been easy – the patient has been complaining about thirst, and last night a family member snuck her a glass of water. She’s a textbook example of how difficult fluid restriction can be.  I’m ready to consider alternative treatments.”<BR><BR>You – “Great. I’d be happy to discuss how Samsca might be helpful in this situation.  Do you have a few minutes for us to talk now? <br><br>Dr. Gomez – “Could you actually come back this afternoon?  I have a patient I’m going to see now.”<br><br>You – “Sure.  I’ll see you then.”</welcomeText>]]></descriptionText>
