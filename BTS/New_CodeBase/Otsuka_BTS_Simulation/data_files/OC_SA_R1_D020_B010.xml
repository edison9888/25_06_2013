The hospital wants to see less expensive prescriptions and shorter lengths of stay, coupled with very low readmission rates.  That’s a difficult balancing act.  Oftentimes, we want to start with a less expensive treatment to see how the patient will respond.  That’s a great practice, but we also need to know when we should jump straight to a more expensive therapy.  In other words, we shouldn’t attempt every low-cost treatment option when the patient needs more expensive therapy right from the start.  As a prescriber, I’d like to know where Samsca falls into the treatment continuum.”</welcomeText>]]></descriptionText>
