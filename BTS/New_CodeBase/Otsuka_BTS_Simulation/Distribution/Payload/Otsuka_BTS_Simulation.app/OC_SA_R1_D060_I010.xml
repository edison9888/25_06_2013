    <emailContent><![CDATA[<welcomeText style=" font-family:Helvetica; font-size:12pt; line-height:18pt; text-align:justify; font-weight:normal; color:#333; display:block; margin:0 10px 10px">Hey, I just wanted to let you know that Dr. Hayes is going to be pretty tied up at a conference this whole week, but we both have time to meet next Monday. It’s good timing, because another rep came by today, and Dr. Hayes spent considerable time talking with her.  I was surprised, as he generally avoids speaking with reps.  However, with their product likely going generic within the next year, I think Dr. Hayes’ interest in the product is increasing.  Just wanted to give you a heads up, since Dr. Hayes always likes to keep the patient cost as low as possible.  Looking forward to seeing you Monday.</welcomeText>]]></emailContent>
