It seems staff members are always trying to catch the doctors between appointments, oftentimes because there’s been a call-back and a patient’s treatment plan needs to change.  Depending on the situation, that may make the doctor late for the next appointment.  Or, if the office staff are busy on the phones pushing through prior-authorizations or speaking with pharmacies or insurance plans, it can be difficult to return calls from our patients promptly.  Of course, that can lead to a domino effect, which may last all day.</welcomeText>]]></descriptionText>
