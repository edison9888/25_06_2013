While it might be an interesting question, it will take you back several steps in the conversation and in a different direction.<BR><BR>The best question to ask at this point is, "If the administrative details can be overcome, what factors or criteria are most important to you when you consider trialing a product that you have never used before?"<BR><BR>This Execute Next Steps question moves you toward taking action and helps you to better understand the current situation.<BR><BR><B>Here is how Dr. Hayes would have answered that question:</B><BR><BR>"It must be efficacious and it must be safe.  Those are the givens.  After that, it should have good insurance coverage, be available at a reasonable cost, and shouldn’t be a hassle for my office to prescribe.  Also, it must be significantly different from products I’m already prescribing – I won’t begin a new product just to have a new product."</welcomeText>]]></descriptionText>
