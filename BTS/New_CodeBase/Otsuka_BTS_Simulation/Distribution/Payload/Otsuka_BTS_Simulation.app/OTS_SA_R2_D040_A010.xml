We need to learn to capitalize on the staff that we already have.  Dr. Roberts has extensive experience and success treating schizophrenia.  Angela Martinez, our APRN, rotates to another clinic where she treats a lot of patients with anxiety and eating disorders.  I have a lot of post-doctorate work with bipolar disorder.  We need to build our credibility in these disease states by being more active in the healthcare community, such as at education events.  We also need to network so that others will know they can make referrals to us.</welcomeText>]]></descriptionText>
