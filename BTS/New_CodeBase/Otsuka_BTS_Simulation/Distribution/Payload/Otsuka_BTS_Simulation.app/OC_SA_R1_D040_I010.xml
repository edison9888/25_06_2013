He has strong viewpoints about achieving our desired patient outcomes, and he doesn’t want to do it in a way that could expose us to additional risk or uncertainty. Unfortunately, he might think a product like yours has the potential to do both. He wants to keep our patients’ wellness out front. Historically, we’ve prescribed a lot of generics and a select number of branded products that we’re all very comfortable with.  If we’re looking to increase prescribing of a particular product, Dr. Hayes would need to be comfortable with that decision.  He won’t be easily persuaded to change his prescribing habits, but I can talk to him about it.<BR><BR>Will Bennett</welcomeText>]]></emailContent>
